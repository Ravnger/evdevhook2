# This file defines accelerometer and gyro mappings for different devices.
# It is embedded directly into executable and editing it is usually DISCOURAGED unless you want to add support for a new device.
# In that case please consider opening a pull request with your added configuration. Thanks!
# Otherwise, use a per-device config file instead. If it doesn't fit your needs open an issue.
#
# You can set environment variable
# G_RESOURCE_OVERLAYS='/org/v1993/evdevhook2/DeviceTypes.ini=/path/to/your/replacement/file.ini'
# when running evdevhook2 if you want to test your changes without recompiling.
